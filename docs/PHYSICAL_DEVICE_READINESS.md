# Physical-device readiness and Watch→iPhone capture fallback

**Version:** 0.3.0 (3)

**Status:** implemented; Xcode build and paired simulator/physical-device validation required.

## Purpose

The Apple Watch keeps direct `URLSession` HTTPS as the primary capture path. A physical Watch may be unable to reach a tailnet-only MagicDNS endpoint directly, depending on how the paired iPhone and VPN route Watch traffic.

For transient transport failures only, Hermes now uses an interactive iPhone fallback:

```text
Watch outbox (durable source)
  → direct HTTPS attempt
  → transient network / HTTP 502, 503, or 504 failure
  → WCSession.sendMessage(payload only)
  → iPhone validates the envelope and dry-run gates
  → iPhone Keychain supplies its own route secret
  → iPhone signs and POSTs to the same BFF
  → response returns to Watch
  → same Watch outbox item becomes sent
```

## Security properties

The fallback message contains the already-created capture payload but never contains:

- HMAC secret;
- bearer token;
- Keychain data;
- broad Hermes API credential;
- private endpoint credentials.

The fallback uses only interactive `WCSession.sendMessage`. It does not use deferred/persistent WatchConnectivity transports such as:

```text
updateApplicationContext
transferUserInfo
transferFile
```

The iPhone rejects fallback payloads unless all of these hold:

- body size is at most 64 KiB;
- event and schema are `mobile_capture.v1` v1;
- request ID is present;
- source platform is `watchOS`;
- source surface is `watch_app` or `app_intent_watch`;
- capture text is nonempty and at most 16 KiB;
- `dry_run == true`;
- `allow_write == false`;
- `allow_firefly_write != true`.

The iPhone accepts the BFF response only when:

```text
dry_run == true
plan.would_write != true
response.request_id == payload.request_id
```

Fallback is intentionally denied for authentication failures, client errors, invalid responses, unsafe responses, and unknown failures. It is eligible only for:

```text
network errors
HTTP 502
HTTP 503
HTTP 504
```

If direct delivery succeeds but its response is lost, fallback/retry reuses the same request ID. The BFF ledger therefore returns a duplicate safely instead of creating a second effect.

## Durability model

The iPhone does not create a second outbox copy for a fallback request. The Watch outbox remains the durable source of truth throughout the interactive attempt.

If the iPhone is not reachable, its app is not active, or the fallback fails, the Watch item remains failed/retryable. No capture is silently discarded.

## Controlled simulator validation

Keep the paired iPhone Hermes app open and reachable. In the Watch scheme, set:

```text
HERMES_SIMULATE_OFFLINE = 1
```

Do not set `HERMES_DISABLE_PHONE_FALLBACK`. Submit a Watch capture.

Expected result:

```text
direct Watch path: simulated offline
Watch→iPhone fallback: used
BFF response: dry-run
Watch history: Enviado
attempt count: 1
```

To test full outage with no fallback, set both:

```text
HERMES_SIMULATE_OFFLINE = 1
HERMES_DISABLE_PHONE_FALLBACK = 1
```

Expected result:

```text
Watch history: Falló
attempt count: 1
```

Disable both variables, relaunch, and press `Reintentar pendientes`. Expected:

```text
same request_id
Watch history: Enviado
attempt count: 2
```

These environment variables are Debug-only.

## Privacy manifest

`Apps/Shared/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` is included in both app targets through the shared source path. It declares:

- no tracking;
- no tracking domains;
- other user content for app functionality;
- purchase history for expense capture functionality;
- pseudonymous device ID for app functionality;
- UserDefaults required-reason API `CA92.1`.

Hermes does not record or transmit raw audio. Dictation uses system UI and the app receives text.

The manifest is intentionally conservative. App Store Connect privacy answers and an Xcode archive privacy report must still be reconciled before TestFlight/App Store distribution.

## Signing

Both targets use:

```text
CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic
```

No `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, certificate, provisioning profile, Apple account ID, or device identifier is committed. Jose selects his personal Apple Development Team locally in Xcode.

## Physical-device QA gates

1. Build iPhone and Watch targets with full Xcode.
2. Install Hermes 0.3.0 (3) on a paired physical iPhone/Watch.
3. Confirm iPhone Tailscale connectivity and BFF health.
4. Provision configuration and secret to Watch via ephemeral bootstrap.
5. Test direct Watch capture with iPhone nearby.
6. Test transient direct failure with iPhone fallback.
7. Test full outage and later retry with the same request ID.
8. Test a manually created Shortcut on iPhone.
9. Test App Shortcut/Siri discovery on physical devices.
10. Inspect the Xcode privacy report and archive validation.

Real writes remain blocked.
